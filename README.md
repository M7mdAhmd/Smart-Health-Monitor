# Real-Time Health Monitoring and Prediction System

This project is an end-to-end real-time health monitoring system integrating IoT and machine learning. It collects vital signs using biomedical sensors connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, stores the data in Firebase, and uses a PyTorch-based deep learning model deployed with Flask to predict health status. A frontend interface displays live sensor readings and model predictions.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of ECG, heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, and body temperature.
- ESP32-based data acquisition and transmission via Wi-Fi.
- PyTorch deep neural network achieving 97% accuracy on health status prediction.
- Flask API for model deployment and integration with Firebase Realtime Database.
- Web-based UI for live data visualization and prediction display.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** ESP32, MAX30102, DS18B20, ECG sensor
- **Backend:** Python, PyTorch, Flask, Firebase
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Model:** Deep Neural Network (DNN)
